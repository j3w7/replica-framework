  abstract = {The development of the Semantic Web, with machine-readable content,
	has the potential to revolutionize the World Wide Web and its uses.
	A Semantic Web Primer provides an introduction and guide to this
	still emerging field, describing its key ideas, languages, and technologies.
	Suitable for use as a textbook or for self-study by professionals,
	it concentrates on undergraduate-level fundamental concepts and techniques
	that will enable readers to proceed with building applications on
	their own and includes exercises, project descriptions, and annotated
	references to relevant online materials. A Semantic Web Primer provides
	a systematic treatment of the different languages (XML, RDF, OWL,
	and rules) and technologies (explicit metadata, ontologies, and logic
	and inference) that are central to Semantic Web development as well
	as such crucial related topics as ontology engineering and application
	scenarios. This substantially revised and updated second edition
	reflects recent developments in the field, covering new application
	areas and tools. The new material includes a discussion of such topics
	as SPARQL as the RDF query language; OWL DLP and its interesting
	practical and theoretical properties; the SWRL language (in the chapter
	on rules); OWL-S (on which the discussion of Web services is now
	based). The new final chapter considers the state of the art of the
	field today, captures ongoing discussions, and outlines the most
	challenging issues facing the Semantic Web in the future. Supplementary
	materials, including slides, online versions of many of the code
	fragments in the book, and links to further reading, can be found

  abstract = {{The realisation of the Semantic Web depends on a number of factors,
	one of which is the ability to reuse ontologies [10]. Ontology construction
	is deemed to be a time consuming and labour intensive task. Therefore
	it heavily relies on the possibility of reusing existing ontologies.
	Nonetheless, ontologies and ontology libraries, for instance the
	DAML ontology library 1 are becoming available, together with the
	first search engines for the retrieval of web ontologies, such as
	Swoogle 2 and Ontosearch 3. However, from an Ontological Engineering
	perspective it can be hard to reuse ontologies, especially when the
	ontologies being reused are large. Currently there are two major
	ways of reusing an ontology. Ontology editors such as Prot\'{e}g\'{e}
	[5] allow the reuse of another ontology by including it in the model
	that is being designed (in Prot\'{e}g\'{e} this happens through the
	inclusion of other projects). The web ontology language OWL[1] offers
	the possibility to import an OWL ontology by means of the \&lt;owl:imports\&gt;
	statement. In both cases, these include the whole ontology. However,
	especially when large ontologies are reused, ontology engineers might
	be interested only in a portion of the original ontologies. For example,
	an engineer is only interested in concepts about and relating to
	diabetes, but they had to import the whole ontology in order to get
	what was required. Reusing only part of an ontology has been the
	starting point for this PhD research that aims to investigate the
	wider notion of ontology modularisation. Ontology modularisation

  abstract = {{To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge
	among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in
	which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational
	vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse—definitions of classes,
	relations, functions, and other objects—is called an ontology. This
	paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable
	over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format
	for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua
	into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as
	well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and
	reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized
	implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability
	addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate
	the stylistic and organizational differences among representations
	while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate
	from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining
	system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency
	of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed
	by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent,
	representational idioms.}},

  comment = {The most widely accepted defining feature of the semantic web is machine-usable
	content. By this definition, the semantic web is already manifest
	in shopping agents that automatically access and use web content
	to find the lowest air fares or book prices. However, where are the
	semantics? Most people regard the semantic web as a vision, not a
	reality—so shopping agents should not ” count.” To use web content,
	machines need to know what to do when they encounter it, which, in
	turn, requires the machine to know what the content means (that is,
	its semantics). The challenge of developing the semantic web is how
	to put this knowledge into the machine. The manner in which it is
	done is at the heart of the confusion about the semantic web. The
	goal of this article is to clear up some of this confusion. I explain
	that shopping agents work in the complete absence of any explicit
	account of the semantics of web content because the meaning of the
	web content that the agents are expected to encounter can be determined
	by the human programmers who hardwire it into the web application
	software. I therefore regard shopping agents as a degenerate case
	of the semantic web. I note various shortcomings of this approach.

  abstract = {As an increasingly large number of {OWL} ontologies become available
	on the Semantic Web and the descriptions in the ontologies become
	more complicated, finding the cause of errors becomes an extremely
	hard task even for experts. Existing ontology development environments
	provide some limited support, in conjunction with a reasoner, for
	reporting errors in {OWL} ontologies. Typically, these are restricted
	to the mere detection of, for example, unsatisfiable concepts. However,
	the diagnosis and resolution of the bug is not supported at all.
	For example, no explanation is given as to why the error occurs (e.
	g., by pinpointing the root clash, or axioms in the ontology responsible
	for the clash) or how dependencies between classes cause the error
	to propagate (i.e., by distinguishing root from derived unsatisfiable
	classes). In the former case, information from the internals of a
	description logic tableaux reasoner can be extracted and presented
	to the user (glass box approach); while in the latter case, the reasoner
	can be used as an oracle for a certain set of questions and the asserted
	structure of the ontology can be used to help isolate the source
	of the problems (black box approach). Based on the two approaches,
	we have integrated a number of debugging cues generated from our
	reasoner, Pellet, in our hypertextual ontology development environment,
	Swoop. A conducted usability evaluation demonstrates that these debugging
	cues significantly improve the {OWL} debugging experience, and point
	the way to more general improvements in the presentation of an ontology
	to users. (c) 2005 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

	surprisingly well on real-world ontologies. We support this claim
