\label{abstract}
This seminar paper presents a novel framework for developing a Distributed
Ontology System (DOS) and tools for Collaborative Ontology Development (COD).
Both topics have much in common but have been dealt with rather separately
up to this point, the framework is an initial step to met requirements of
both fields.
In addition to the presentation of the concept, an implementation of the
Replica Framework is also discussed in this work.

First, the work is motivated, then the reader will be taught
fundamentals of the Semantic Web and related technologies. The terms
DOS and COD are explained and aspects of both fields relevant to the Replica Framework.
The presentation of the framework model and components as well
as the presentation of the backend and frontend implementation follows.
Finally conclusions are drawn and an outlook of future work is given.
