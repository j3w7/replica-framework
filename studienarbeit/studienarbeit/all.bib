	similarity measures, the graph isomorphism measure and the subgraph
	isomorphism measure. The graph isomorphism measure detects structurally
	identical graphs and calculates the similarity upon the nearness
	of the node labels. Structurally different graphs are compared by
	the subgraph isomorphism measure to find matching parts. The size
	and the label similarity of the nodes of a matched part contribute
	to its similarity based upon the compared graphs. The highest similarity
	value of all parts is defined to be the similarity of the two graphs.
	Performance improvements were developed and implemented which led

	 Different OWL reasoners, however, specialise in different reasoning

	 which connects to different existing reasoning systems and intelligently
	
	 delegates reasoning requests. The behaviour of the broker is controlled
	
	 by exchangeable and configurable broker strategies featuring selection
	
	 and parallelisation of reasoners, centralised caching, simulated
	anytime
	
	 reasoning, and various other potential features. A first experiment
	shows
	
	 performance improvement for a sequence of queries compared to the
	use
	
	 of different single reasoners.

  school = {Faculty of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics of the University
	of Innsbruck},
  year = {2008},
  address = {Innsbruck, Austria},
  abstract = {The recent advent of the Semantic Web has increased the interest in
	the use of formal Knowledge Representation (KR) languages in order
	to allow automated processing of, and reasoning with, information
	on the Web. A prominent KR paradigm on the Web is the family of Description
	Logics (DLs), which are subsets of classical First-Order Logic (FOL);
	the W3C Web Ontology Language OWL, and especially its sub-language
	OWL DL, is strongly related to DL. Another KR paradigm receiving
	widespread attention in this context is that of rules, in the form
	of Logic Programming (LP); it is used in, for example, Semantic Web
	policies and Semantic Web services. Meta-modeling is a feature many
	deem useful, or even necessary, for the Semantic Web, and is present
	in the Semantic Web languages RDFS and OWL Full. F-Logic is a formalism
	that allows meta-modeling, in the spirit of RDFS, but is in many
	respects more in line with standard KR and database languages.\\
	\noindent \emph{It is the goal of this thesis to combine DL ontologies,
	LP rules, and meta-modeling capabilities in a single unifying language
	framework for the Semantic Web.}\\ \noindent We propose WSML as such
	a unifying framework. The WSML-DL sub-language corresponds to the
	DL $\mathcal{SHIQ}$, and the WSML-Rule sub-language corresponds to
	LP with negation, extended with F-Logic-based meta-modeling. Interoperation
	between these sub-languages can be achieved through a common subset
	(WSML-Core) or a common superset (WSML-Full). In the technical design
	of the subset and the superset we face two major challenges: the
	combination of DL-style and F-Logic-style ontology modeling, and
	the interoperation between ontologies based on classical FOL (e.g.,
	DL) and rules based on nonmonotonic LP.\\ -- We address the combination
	of DL-style and F-Logic-style ontology modeling by defining a straightforward
	translation from FOL to F-Logic, and show that this translation preserves
	validity for the class of \emph{cardinal} formulas. We exhibit a
	novel class of cardinal formulas that includes the DL $\mathcal{SHIQ}$.
	We use this result to show that the translation from $\mathcal{SHIQ}$
	to F-Logic preserves entailment.\\ -- We address the interoperation
	between FOL and LP by analyzing a number of representational issues
	that occur when combining FOL theories with logic programs, and present
	a novel approach to combining FOL and LP using \emph{first-order
	autoepistemic logic}, an expressive nonmonotonic logic, as a unifying
	formalism that features a tight integration between the rules and
	the ontology. We show how different embeddings of logic programs
	lead to difference semantics for the combination.\\ \noindent Using
	these technical results, we specify a semantic framework for WSML,
	define WSML-Core and WSML-Full, and discuss language layering in
	WSML.\\ \noindent To address the relationship with the basic Semantic
	Web language RDF(S) we define embeddings of the language in F-Logic,
	and demonstrating how standard KR techniques can be used for reasoning
	with and extending RDFS. Finally, we consider \emph{intensional}
	OWL, a variant of OWL Full more suitable for rule-based processing
	and extension.},

  abstract = {The Semantic Web languages RDFS and OWL have been around for some
	time now. However, the presence of these languages has not brought
	the breakthrough of the Semantic Web the creators of the languages
	had hoped for. OWL has a number of problems in the area of interoperability
	and usability in the context of many practical application scenarios
	which impede the connection to the Software Engineering and Database
	communities. In this paper we present OWL Flight, which is loosely
	based on OWL, but the semantics is grounded in Logic Programming
	rather than Description Logics, and it borrows the constraint-based
	modeling style common in databases. This results in different types
	of modeling primitives and enforces a different style of ontology
	modeling. We analyze the modeling paradigms of OWL DL and OWL Flight,
	as well as reasoning tasks supported by both languages. We argue
	that different applications on the Semantic Web require different
	styles of modeling and thus both types of languages are required
	for the Semantic Web.},

  abstract = {Words and phrases acquire meaning from the way they are used in society,
	from their relative semantics to other words and phrases. For computers,
	the equivalent of "society" is "database," and the equivalent of
	"use" is "a way to search the database". We present a new theory
	of similarity between words and phrases based on information distance
	and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts, we use the World Wide
	Web (WWW) as the database, and Google as the search engine. The method
	is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory
	is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity,
	the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the WWW
	using Google page counts. The WWW is the largest database on earth,
	and the context information entered by millions of independent users
	averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We
	give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and
	language translation. We give examples to distinguish between colors
	and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters
	and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand
	emergencies and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple
	automatic English-Spanish translation. Finally, we use the WordNet
	database as an objective baseline against which to judge the performance
	of our method. We conduct a massive randomized trial in binary classification
	using support vector machines to learn categories based on our Google
	distance, resulting in an a mean agreement of 87 percent with the
	expert crafted WordNet categories},

  title = {On Belief Change and Ontology Evolution},
  school = {UNIVERSITY OF CRETE, DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {One of the crucial tasks to be performed towards the realization of
	the vision of the Semantic Web is the encoding of human knowledge
	in special structures (ontologies), using formal representation languages.
	Simply creating an ontology is not enough though; knowledge needs
	to be updated as well. There are several reasons why knowledge in
	an ontology would need to change: changes could be initiated because
	of a change in the world being modeled; the users needs may change,
	requiring a different conceptualization; knowledge previously unknown,
	classified or otherwise unavailable may become known; or a design
	flaw may have been noticed in the original conceptualization. In
	all these cases, the ontological representation would need to be
	modified so as to form a more accurate conceptualization of the domain.
	In this dissertation, we will use the generic term ontology change
	to refer to the process of modifying an ontology in response to any
	given need. This generic term engulfs several different, but closely
	related research fields, including ontology evolution, alignment,
	merging, mapping and others. The first part of this dissertation
	deals with all these disciplines, performing a shallow, yet broad
	review of recent work in those areas and proposing a certain terminology
	in a field plagued by the use of underspecified and confusing terms.
	This will allow us to draw a fine line between these closely related
	and often overlapping research efforts. The second part of this dissertation
	focuses on ontology evolution, which refers to the process of modifying
	an ontology in response to a change in the domain or its conceptualization.
	We will argue that current research on ontology evolution is misguided
	and leads to several problems, mostly related to the heavy dependency
	of the process on human participation and the lack of adequate formalizations.
	The key idea of our proposal towards resolving these deficiencies
	is the use of intuitions from the closely related field of belief
	change, which deals with the updating of knowledge stored in Knowledge
	Bases. We will study the connections between the two fields and propose
	a formalization for ontology evolution that facilitates the migration
	of belief change techniques, tools, ideas, results and intuitions
	to the problem of ontology evolution. The solutions proposed in the
	belief change literature generally have all the properties desirable
	for an ontology evolution algorithm (automatic determination and
	implementation of changes, formal character and well-studied theoretical
	properties), so they could be of use in the ontology evolution field.
	This way, ontology evolution researchers will not have to reinvent
	the wheel for problems whose counterparts have already been studied
	in the belief change literature and will be protected from potential
	pitfalls and dead ends. It is obvious that exhaustively pursuing
	the migration of belief change techniques to the ontology evolution
	field is a long-term goal, not achievable within the framework and
	- ii - limitations of a PhD dissertation. For this reason, this part
	of our work will only provide abstract ideas towards this direction.
	Our aim at this point will be merely to provide the necessary theoretical
	foundations and connections upon which future research could be based,
	hopefully leading to more concrete solutions to the problem of ontology
	evolution. Following this abstract study, our research will focus
	on a certain belief change theory, namely the AGM theory, which is
	the most influential approach in the field of belief change. This
	study constitutes the third part of this thesis and its aim is to
	provide an exemplary application of the general research path we
	are proposing, as well as to show its feasibility. Our study of the
	AGM theory will be initiated by an attempt to generalize it so as
	to be applicable to logics that are used for ontological representation.
	The AGM theory, like most belief change approaches, focuses on classical
	logic, disallowing, among others, the main formalisms used in ontologies,
	like Description Logics (DLs) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL).
	Our generalization will cover a vast class of monotonic logics and
	show that the AGM theory is actually applicable to a certain class
	of logics much wider than the original class studied by AGM. Our
	study will also uncover interesting theoretical properties of the
	AGM theory, as well as its connection with other formalisms, like
	the foundational model and lattice theory. In the fourth part of
	this dissertation, our focus will be further narrowed so as to refer
	to the main ontology representation formalisms, namely DLs and OWL.
	We will provide specialized conditions under which members of these
	families of logics are compatible (or incompatible) with the AGM
	theory, as well as several heuristics and results allowing one to
	determine this compatibility (or incompatibility) for logics not
	covered by this work. The main results of this part of our study
	is that certain DLs, as well as OWL, are not compatible with the
	AGM theory, while in other DLs the AGM theory can be successfully
	applied for the development of ontology evolution algorithms; for
	the latter category of DLs, an algorithm (operator) performing contraction
	that is compatible with the AGM theory is described.},

	sight, this seems almost trivial, but annotations are needed for
	different levels of description, these need to be related to each
	other in the appropriate way and, in particular on the Semantic Web,
	annotations may not all be stored in the same place. We distinguish
	between technical descriptions of a media asset from content-level
	descriptions. At both levels, the annotations needed in a single
	application may come from different vocabularies. In addition, the
	instantiated values for a term used from an ontology also need to
	be specified. We present a number of existing vocabularies related
	to multimedia, discuss the above problems then discuss requirements
	for and the desirability of a lightweight multimedia ontology. },

	contributions. The Semantic Web is an ecosystem of data, where value
	is created by the integration of structured data from many sources.
	What applications can best synthesize the strengths of these two
	approaches, to create a new level of value that is both rich with
	human participation and powered by well-structured information? This
	paper proposes a class of applications called collective knowledge
	systems, which unlock the "collective intelligence" of the Social

  pages = {90-96},
  abstract = {For years, ontologies have been known in computer science as consensual
	models of domains of discourse, usually implemented as formal definitions
	of the relevant conceptual entities. Researchers have written much
	about the potential benefits of using them, and most of us regard
	ontologies as central building blocks of the semantic Web and other
	semantic systems. Unfortunately, the number and quality of actual,
	"non-toy" ontologies available on the Web today is remarkably low.
	This implies that the semantic Web community has yet to build practically
	useful ontologies for a lot of relevant domains in order to make
	the semantic Web a reality. Theoretically minded advocates often
	assume that the lack of ontologies is because the "stupid business
	people haven't realized ontologies' enormous benefits." As a liberal
	market economist, the author assumes that humans can generally figure
	out what's best for their well-being, at least in the long run, and
	that they act accordingly. In other words, the fact that people haven't
	yet created as many useful ontologies as the ontology research community
	would like might indicate either unresolved technical limitations
	or the existence of sound rationales for why individuals refrain
	from building them - or both. Indeed, several social and technical
	difficulties exist that put a brake on developing and eventually
	constrain the space of possible ontologies},

	based on it) functions as a gold standard, but applications dealing
	with large-scale and noisy data usually cannot afford the required
	runtimes. Approximate methods, including deductive ones, but also
	approaches based on entirely different methods like machine learning
	or nature-inspired computing need to be investigated, while quality
	assurance needs to be done in terms of precision and recall values
	(as in information retrieval) and not necessarily in terms of soundness

	as useful additions to OWL-DL, and which, additionally, do not affect
	its decidability and practicability. We consider complex role inclusion
	axioms of the form R . S . R or S . R . R to express propagation
	of one property along another one, which have proven useful in medical
	terminologies. Furthermore, we extend SHOIN with reflexive, antisymmetric,
	and irreflexive roles, disjoint roles, a universal role, and constructs
	R.Self, allowing, for instance, the definition of concepts such as
	a â narcistâ . Finally, we consider negated role assertions in Aboxes
	and qualified number restrictions. The resulting logic is called
	SROIQ. We present a rather elegant tableau-based reasoning algorithm:
	it combines the use of automata to keep track of universal value
	restrictions with the techniques developed for SHOIQ. The logic SROIQ
	has been adopted as the logical basis for the next iteration of OWL,

	that the standard set of entailment rules for RDFS is incomplete
	and that this can be corrected by allowing blank nodes in predicate
	position.We define semantic extensions of RDFS that involve datatypes
	and a subset of the OWL vocabulary that includes the property-related
	vocabulary (e.g. FunctionalProperty), the comparisons (e.g. sameAs
	and differentFrom) and the value restrictions (e.g. allValuesFrom).
	These semantic extensions are in line with the `if-semantics' of
	RDFS and weaker than the `iff-semantics' of D-entailment and OWL
	(DL or Full). For these semantic extensions we present entailment
	rules, prove completeness results, prove that consistency is in P
	and that, just as for RDFS, entailment is NP-complete, and in P if
	the target graph does not contain blank nodes. There are no restrictions
	on use to obtain decidability: classes can be used as instances.},

  title = {Adding Multimedia to the Semantic Web --- Building an {MPEG-7} Ontology},
  year = {2001},
  abstract = {For the past two years the Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG), a
	working group of ISO/IEC, have been developing MPEG-7 [1], the "Multimedia
	Content Description Interface", a standard for describing multimedia
	content. The goal of this standard is to develop a rich set of standardized
	tools to enable both humans and machines to generate and understand
	audiovisual descriptions which can be used to enable fast efficient
	retrieval from digital archives (pull applications) as well as filtering
	of streamed audiovisual broadcasts on the Internet (push applications).
	MPEG-7 is intended to describe audiovisual information regardless
	of storage, coding, display, transmission, medium, or technology.
	It will address a wide variety of media types including: still pictures,
	graphics, 3D models, audio, speech, video, and combinations of these
	(e.g., multimedia presentations). MPEG-7 is due for completion in
	October 2001. At this stage MPEG-7 definitions (description schemes
	and descriptors) are expressed solely in XML Schema [2-4]. XML Schema
	has been ideal for expressing the syntax, structural, cardinality
	and datatyping constraints required by MPEG-7. However it has become
	increasingly clear that in order to make MPEG-7 accessible, re-usable
	and interoperable with other domains then the semantics of the MPEG-7
	metadata terms also need to be expressed in an ontology using a machine-understandable
	language. This paper describes the trials and tribulations of building
	such an ontology represented in RDF Schema [5] and demonstrates how
	this ontology can be exploited and reused by other communities on
	the semantic web (such as TV-Anytime [6], MPEG-21 [7], NewsML [8],
	museum, educational and geospatial domains) to enable the inclusion
	and exchange of multimedia content through a common understanding
	of the associated MPEG-7 multimedia content descriptions.},

	such a way that allows learners to experience the important variations
	in the critical aspects of the content to be learned. This paper
	reports on the experience of designing such special kinds of instructional
	learning objects for the learning of Chinese characters. The design
	of these learning objects takes into consideration not only what
	Chinese characters are all about but also how learners commonly make
	errors while they learn to write the characters. Out of the analysis
	of these learners' errors, variations in the structural features
	of Chinese characters were pulled out and embodied in the design
	of the learning objects. Learners tinkering with the learning objects
	can thus implicitly develop a sense of the structural features or
	regularity of Chinese characters, which most importantly should prepare
	the learners to learn more new characters in the future. The main
	proposal of this paper is the notion of this variation-affording
	instructional software that allows learners to attend to the essential
	aspects of what is to be learned. Furthermore, the idea of the learning
	object also differs from other instructional software in its small,
	self-contained and reusable nature, such that teachers can flexibly
	embed the learning objects into their own teaching materials.}

	Chinese characters are composed from a limited number of common components.
	For example, the characters for pond(), lake(), stream(), river(),
	sea() and ocean() all contain a component in common, a three-dot
	component representing water. When this clue is explicitly highlighted
	to students, the learning of Chinese characters can be greatly enhanced.
	Using a computer to help students to develop this kind of structural
	awareness about language learning has not yet been thoroughly examined.
	This paper reports on the design of CALL software based on a pedagogic
	method which helps students to develop the higher order skills to
	analyse and categorise Chinese characters by using components. The
	result of the classroom experiment has shown supportive evidence
	on the feasibility and the need of integrating the software with
	an affective and contextual way of teaching Chinese characters.}

  abstract = {Natural languages like English have been constrained in expressing
	perceptions like vision, sound and touch for years despite the efforts
	of Joyce (1922, 1939) and others. In situ, lexicons have been limited
	in their form and content. They have typically been structured in
	the form of sequences of natural language words with their content
	defined using flat symbolic descriptions in natural languages. In
	particular, we believe that today's dictionaries in general, and
	with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in particular,
	are unnatural in the sense that they do not encode pictures for words
	just like we do in our heads. There is now a move towards integrated
	systems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) (see Dennett 1991; Mc Kevitt
	1994a, 1994b) and that will cause a need for dire actions on lexical
	research in the form of integrated lexicons. We believe that lexicons
	must move towards a situation where natural language words are also
	defined in terms of spatial and visual structures. These spatial
	and visual structures will solve what have been two of the most prominent
	problems in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for years:
	(1) Where are symbolic semantic primitive meanings in computer programs
	grounded? and (2) how come some words, typically in the defining
	vocabulary, in dictionaries have circular definitions so that words
	end up defining each other? We believe integrated lexicons will cause
	these two problems to go away and hence help solve Searle's Chinese
	Room Problem and move more towards Irish Rooms of people like James
	Joyce.},

	links (KCLs) in 3 6th-grade classrooms that varied in degree of learner
	centeredness. KCLs are operationalized as prior learning that students
	bring to their current classroom experiences and include school and
	nonschool experiences. They are hypothesized to facilitate a knowledge-construction
	process that values prior learning. In the more learner-centered
	classroom, KCLs occurred in conjunction with open and divergent dialogue,
	positive reactions to students' use of prior learning, and opportunities
	within the classroom that allowed students to gain new experiences
	on which they could draw in further knowledge-construction efforts.
	In contrast, KCLs were ignored or viewed as inappropriate in the
	least learner-centered classroom, dialogue about content was convergent,
	and performance goals were the norm. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

	Standards fÃ r die Strukturierung von semantischen Informationen
	lÃ ngst vereinbart worden sind (XML, RDF, OWL, SPARQL), hat der typische
	Anwender noch keine BerÃ hrungen mit dem Semantic Web machen kÃ nnen.
	Einerseits liegen nur wenige semantische Wissensbasen vor, die zu
	durchforsten von Interesse wÃ ren, andererseits liegt auch nur wenig
	Software vor, welche solche Durchforstungen unterstÃ tzt. Diese Arbeit
	beschreibt Semantic Crystal, einen Prototyp einer solchen Software.
	Er zeigt Klassen und Verbindungen aus OWL-Wissensbasen graphisch
	dar und unterstÃ tzt â ebenfalls graphisch â den Aufbau einer Abfrage.
	Obwohl die Abfrage schliesslich in der komplexen Sprache SPARQL vorliegt,
	wird sie durch die graphische Darstellung reprÃ sentiert, dass sie
	fÃ r einen breiten Benutzerkreis verstÃ ndlich und leicht bedienbar
	ist. Abstract Although standards for structuring semantic information
	have been available for a long time (XML, RDF, OWL, SPARQL), most
	typical users have not yet encountered the semantic web. There are
	mainly two reasons for this: There are not many semantic knowledge
	bases available which could be interesting to query, and there is
	not much software to support such queries neither. Therefore this
	research paper presents Semantic Crystal, a prototype of such a query
	software. Semantic Crystal displays classes and relationships from
	OWL knowledge bases graphically and supports the setup of a query
	â graphically as well. Although the query eventually exists in the
	intricate language SPARQL, it will be comprehensible by a broad number
	of users due to its graphical representation.},

	auto-matically. The proposed approach consists of three contributions:
	
	1. A core ontology, YAGO.
	
	YAGO is an ontology that has been constructed automatically. It combines
	high accuracy with large coverage and serves as a core that can be
	expanded.
	
	2. A tool for information extraction, LEILA.
	
	LEILA is a system that can extract knowledge from natural language
	texts. LEILA will be used to 2nd new facts for YAGO.
	
	3. An integration mechanism, SOFIE.
	
	SOFIE is a system that can reason on the plausibility of new knowledge.
	SOFIE will assess the facts found by LEILA and integrate theminto
	YAGO.
	
	Each of these components comes with a fully implemented system. Together,they
	form an integrative architecture, which does not only gather new
	facts,but also reconcile them with the existing facts. The result
	is an ever-growing,yet highly accurate ontological knowledge base.
	A survey of applications of theontology completes the thesis.},

  abstract = {OntoClean is an approach towards the formal evaluation of taxonomic
	relations in ontologies. The application of OntoClean consists of
	two main steps. First, concepts are tagged according to meta-properties
	known as rigidity, unity, dependency and identity. Second, the tagged
	concepts are checked according to predefined constraints to discover
	taxonomic errors. Although OntoClean is well documented in numerous
	publications, it is still used rather infrequently due to the high
	costs of application. Especially, the manual tagging of concepts
	with the correct meta-properties requires substantial efforts of
	highly experienced ontology engineers. In order to facilitate the
	use of OntoClean and to enable the evaluation of real-world ontologies,
	we provide AEON, a tool which automatically tags concepts with appropriate
	OntoClean meta-properties and performs the constraint checking. We
	use the Web as an embodiment of world knowledge, where we search
	for patterns that indicate how to properly tag concepts. We thoroughly
	evaluated our approach against a manually created gold standard.
	The evaluation shows the competitiveness of our approach while at
	the same time significantly lowering the costs. All of our results,
	i.e. the tool AEON as well as the experiment data, are publicly available.},

  abstract = {Concepts maps are used to represent domain knowledge, mostly by attaching
	word labels to a static graph. For concepts and relations which unfold
	in time, this representation is not well suited because temporal
	relations have to be mapped to static ones. This can be useful to
	understand and memorize structures, but it detaches the representation
	in the map from its temporal nature. One approach of introducing
	dynamics into concept maps is the integration of multimedia elements.
	These elements can display dynamic content like audio and video,
	but do not affect the map's structure. The temporal aspect of a domain
	can be represented in a concept map by changing the appearance of
	nodes or edges over time. A second approach is to change the perspective
	on the map, e.g. showing a different part of the map, and a third
	one is to change the structure of the map dynamically. The first
	and the third approach have been realized by the authors in a prototypical
	software for mapping musical structures. Music provides an excellent
	test bed for dynamic concept maps, since is has complex inherent
	temporal structures (e.g. harmony, rhythm, form). Our software supports
	dynamic mapping by using dynamic nodes displays, e.g. with a cursor
	highlighting the song position, and by allowing to change the structure
	according to music playback, e.g. showing only nodes that are currently
	played back, or building up a map during playback.}
