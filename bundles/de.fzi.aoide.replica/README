How to develop with the Replica Framework

The Replica Framework implementation is meant to be used with Eclipse.
All modules are implemented as OSGi bundles. Some modules require the ECF and
AspectJ plugins for Eclipse.

Here are the necessary steps to use the Replica Framework code base in Eclipse:

  1. Download and install Eclipse,
  	see http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
     PDE is required too, which is included in the EE edition,
     	see http://www.eclipse.org/pde/downloads/
  
  2. Install the ECF plugin for Eclipse (via remote update site),
  	see http://www.eclipse.org/ecf/downloads.php
  	
  3. Install the AJDT plugin for Eclipse (via remote update site),
  	see http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/downloads/
  	
  4. Import all plugins
  	File > Import... > Plug-in Development > Plug-ins and Fragments.
  	Select the "Import From" to the directory containing the Replica
  	Framework bundles.
  	
  5. Have fun! :)
